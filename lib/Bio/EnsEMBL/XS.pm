=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::XS - C extensions of the Ensembl API

=head1 VERSION

Version 1.2.1

=cut

our $VERSION = '1.2.1'; 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Efficient implementations of Ensembl API routines and methods in C.

    # First (not recommended) mode of operation, i.e. directly use 
    # the fast reimplementation of Bio::EnsEMBL::Utils::Argument::rearrange, 
    # e.g.

    use Bio::EnsEMBL::XS;

    my ($one, $two, $three) = 
      Bio::EnsEMBL::XS::Utils::Argument::rearrange(['one','tWO','THRee'], 
                                                   ('-TwO' => 2,
                                                    '-oNE' => 1,
                                                    '-THreE' => 3));

    # Second (recommended) mode of operation, i.e. import the original 
    # module which will then detect whether Bio::EnsEMBL::XS is installed and
    # use its reimplementation instead, e.g.

    use Bio::EnsEMBL::Utils::Argument;

    # use Bio::EnsEMBL::XS::Utils::Argument::rearrage if Bio::EnsEMBL is installed
    my ($one, $two, $three) = rearrange(['one','tWO','THRee'], 
                                        ('-TwO' => 2,
                                         '-oNE' => 1,
                                         '-THreE' => 3));
    

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Bio::EnsEMBL::XS module only exists to provide dynamic loading of 
all compiled and installed extensions written for specific parts of the 
Ensembl API.

The namespace is organised to closely mirror that of the original Ensembl
API, with the difference of an extra 'XS' put between 'Bio::EnsEMBL' and
what would appear as the rest in the original module namespace, e.g. 
'Utils::Argument'.

The module supports two modes of operation. In the first one, you import 
Bio::EnsEMBL::XS and then directly call the optimised version of a method.
The second mode is designed to be the most transparent and hence the 
preferred way. You just import the original module, which will then detect 
whether Bio::EnsEMBL::XS has been installed in the system and use the 
corresponding optimised version of the module's method.

The first release features one fast reimplementation of the method rearrange
of module Bio::EnsEMBL::Argument.
